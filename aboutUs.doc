*Name: AgriCare

AgriCare was founded on the principle that sustainable farming and waste reduction go hand-in-hand.
Mission Statement: Our mission is to empower farmers to increase production while minimizing waste.

Our Story

Our story began with a simple observation: farmers often struggle to find markets for their excess produce, while waste management companies seek organic materials to process. We saw an opportunity to bridge this gap.

*The Solution*
AgriCare connects farmers with consumers, while connecting waste to recycling companies, facilitating the sale of crops. We also use pay the waste pickers to buy food form the farmers. 

Our goals
By creating this closed-loop system, we aim to:

1. Increase farmer incomes through additional revenue streams.
2. Reduce waste sent to landfills.
3. Promote sustainable agriculture practices.
4. Support local food systems.
5. Encourage environmental neatness 
Provide support for waste pickers and grant them access to food.
